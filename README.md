  ## Description 
  The Workout Tracker app is built with a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express. The app allows the user to view, create and track daily workouts, by logging multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. The app will track the users the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, it will track the distance traveled.
